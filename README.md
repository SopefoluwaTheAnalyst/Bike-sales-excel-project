# Bike Sales Dashboard

Objective:
This project aims to gain insights into the factors that influence bike purchases. This involves cleaning the data by removing duplicates, categorizing ages into different brackets, and creating a dashboard with relevant visualizations.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, i performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Elimination of duplicate records from the dataset to ensure data accuracy.
3. To facilitate analysis, i created a new column named "Age Bracket" using IF conditions to group ages into:
   - Adolescent
   -  Middle-age
   -  old

### Data Analysis
1. Pivot Table
   - Utilize Excel's pivot table features to summarize and analyse data.
2. Pivot Chart
   - I created the following pivot charts for insightful visualizations:
     - Bar Chart: Average Salary Comparison
       - Implemented a bar chart to visualize the average salary comparisons between bike purchasers and non-purchasers, categorized by gender.
     - Line Chart: Bike Purchases Trends Across Age Groups
       - Developed a line chart that showcase trends in bike purchases across different age group.
     - Line Chart: Impact of Commute Distance on Bike Purchases
