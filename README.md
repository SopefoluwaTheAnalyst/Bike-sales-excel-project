# Bike Sales Dashboard

Objective:
This project aims to gain insights into the factors that influence bike purchases. This involves cleaning the data by removing duplicates, categorizing ages into different brackets, and creating a dashboard with relevant visualizations.

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, i performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Elimination of duplicate records from the dataset to ensure data accuracy.
3. To facilitate analysis, i created a new column named "Age Bracket" using IF conditions to group ages into:
   - Adolescent
   -  Middle-age
   -  old

## Data Visualizations
1. Bar Chart: Average Salary Comparison
   - Implemented a bar chart to visualize the average salary comparisons between bike purchasers and non-purchasers, categorized by gender.
2. Line Chart: Bike Purchases Trends Across Age Groups
   - Developed a line chart that showcase trends in bike purchases across different age group.
3. Line Chart: Impact of Commute Distance on Bike Purchases
   - Illustrate the relationship between commute distance and bike purchases.

## Interactive Element
### Marital Status and Region Slicers:
Improved the dashboard by incorporating slicers for Marital Status and Region.
This improvement enables users to dynamically filter and explore the dataset based on marital status and geographical regions.
The addition of slicers facilitates a more detailed analysis, allowing for a deeper understanding of how marital status and regional factors influence bike purchases.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the relationship between average salary and bike purchases across genders?
- Which age group have the highest frequency of bike purchases?
- Does commute distance have an influence on the likelihood of bike purchases?

## Insights and Observations
- The analysis reveals a significant relationship between average salary and bike purchases across genders. Indicating that a higher average salary is linked with increased bike purchases across both male and female categories.
- A notable observation is that the middle-aged group is identified as the group with the highest frequency of bike purchases.
- This analysis emphasizes the importance of commute distance on the likelihood of bike purchases. Notably, shorter commute distances are associated with a higher likelihood of bike purchases, while longer distances correlate with a decreased likelihood of bike ownership.

## Conclusion
The Bike Sales Dashboard provides valuable insights into the factors influencing bike purchases. The visualizations facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the average salary comparison, age-wise trends, and the impact of commute distance on bike purchases. These insights can inform strategic decision-making in marketing and sales efforts.
